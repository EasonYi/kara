# Kara Web Framework

Kara is a web framework for the JVM using the [Kotlin programming language](http://kotlinlang.org/). It uses Kotlin's unique syntax to allow developers to write succinct, statically-typed HTML and CSS all in one language.

To get a quick overview over the project, check out [karaframework.com](http://karaframework.com/). (Note that technical details are outdated at the moment.)

If you want to understand the motivation behind Kara you should read the article ["Type-safe Web with Kotlin"](http://jaxenter.com/type-safe-web-with-kotlin-106187.html) by Andrey Breslav.

## Authors

The project was started by [Tiny Mission](http://tinymission.com), a small web and mobile development company hoping to use Kara as a help to work faster and write better code. 

Currently, it is actively developed by [JetBrains](http://jetbrains.com), the company behind Kotlin.

## Contributing

There's plenty of work left to do to make Kara a first class framework, and we'd welcome contributions. Contact andy at tinymission.com to get involved.
